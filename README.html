<h1>WarlightAiBot</h1>

<p>A warlight AI bot framework for the theaigames.</p>

<p>It's currently functional.  The only bot right now is "Sgt. Stupid", who is pretty true
to his name.</p>

<p>More intelligent bots are planned.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p><strong>Game</strong>: Contains the main constructs for a game.  SuperRegions, Regions, Players, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Engine</strong>: The warlight command engine.  Commands are broken out individually so they should
be easy to understand and impliment.</p>

<p><strong>Botting</strong>:  This is where the bot login resides.  To create a new bot, impliment IBot.</p>

<h3>Current Bots</h3>

<ul>
<li>Sgt. Stupid - A basic bot that doesn't have much in the way of strategic thinking.</li>
</ul>
